#  DynamicPO

> **Official Implementation of "DynamicPO: Dynamic Preference Optimization for Recommendation".**

## 📋 Requirements
You can refer to the `requirements.txt`, or install the core modules with:

- **Python**: `python>=3.9`
- **PyTorch**: `2.4.0`
- **Transformers**: `4.43.3`
- **Hardware**: 4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs
To install using pip, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Data Preparation

Extract the data files to prepare LastFM dataset:

```bash
cd ./data
unzip lastfm-sft-cans20.zip
```

This will generate the train, validation, and test datasets for LastFM.

### 2️⃣ Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)

Start the SFT training process:

```bash
sh ./scripts/sft.sh &
```

### 3️⃣ Multi-Negative Preference Optimization (DMPO-based DynamicPO)

Run the DynamicPO training:

```bash
sh ./scripts/DynamicPO_DMPO.sh &
```

### 4️⃣ Model Inference

Perform inference with the trained model:

```bash
sh ./scripts/inference.sh &
```

## Acknowledgment
Our implementation is built upon the [TRL library](https://github.com/huggingface/trl). We are grateful to the authors of [DMPO](https://github.com/BZX667/DMPO) and [S-DPO](https://github.com/chenyuxin1999/S-DPO) for their insightful work on multi-negative preference optimization for recommendation systems, which inspired parts of this work.
